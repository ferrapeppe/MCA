# MCA - Giuseppe Ferraro's Dataset 2206850F

My dataset includes ten different tracks from the Pokémon Gold/Silver Version soundtrack. Pokémon Gold was the first videogame I ever owned, so I decided to pay homage to some of the tracks that basically made my childood by curating this dataset.
The theme I chose has already been curated on Ninsheet, where we can find notated data in the form of computerized scores, and acoustic data in the form of playable MIDI files.
